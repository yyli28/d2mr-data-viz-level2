## Additional information

1. Did you complete the project with direct collaborators or general support? If so, who did you collaborate with and what was/were their contribution(s)?
    1. Direct collaborators (students who will be turning in a version of the same project) and their contributions:
    2. General support (students who helped you with debugging, conceptual understanding, or the like) and their contributions:
2. Did you use LLMs or other AI models to generate text or code for this project? If so, which tools did you use and how did you use them? Remember in this class you *are* allowed (even encouraged) to use these tools for help with coding, but not for writing text. This can be very brief, just one or two sentences is fine unless you have more you'd like to add.
    1. answer here 
3. For off-the-menu projects only, did you complete the project as proposed? If not, what changed?
    1. answer here or n/a

## Assessed Objectives

Mark an objective attempt for any learning objectives you believe you have demonstrated in this assignment.

Mark when an objective attempt should count toward the 20 unique objectives requirement. If your attempt is successful, your grader will mark the standard as met on your objective-tracker document.

Below each learning objective is a list of general expectations for meeting that objective. You should aim to meet all expectations to earn a point for meeting the objective, but these are not rigid requirements. For example, writing a complex and creative function that uses multiple arguments and returns a complex output could meet the "parse and define functions and arguments" objective, even if it is only used in one context.

## Unassessed Objectives & Off-the-Syllabus Skills

You may earn points toward the 20 additional objectives-based points by demonstrating any of the following skills, or by demonstrating "off-the-syllabus" skills related to the course but not directly covered in class. These cannot count toward demonstration of 20 unique objectives.

## Unassessed learning objectives

The following learning objectives are not required for the course grade but are important for your development as a data scientist. They may be demonstrated in the mini-projects as part of the additional 20 points earned beyond the 20 for unique, assessed standards.

You are not required to demonstrate these objectives in your independent project, but incorporating them can enhance the overall quality of your project and add to the engagement component of the project grade.

### Troubleshooting, debugging, and best practices

1.  use frequent, informative comments in code and markdown
2.  find and understand documentation for R packages and functions
3.  follow a debugging workflow with independent and collaborative strategies
4.  parse and investigate error messages
5.  follow a coding style guide

### RStudio & R

6.  customize RStudio
7.  use BibTeX with `citr` and Zotero integration
8.  parse and write complex `for` and `while` loops
9.  create and use intermediate datasets
10. determine when code is better suited for a sourced script vs. a notebook chunk and source scripts appropriately

### Conceptual skills

11. explain and apply the “grammar of graphics”
12. name and differentiate R data types
13. name and differentiate R objects
14. define “tidy” data and explain its advantages and disadvantages
15. recognize and interpret common data visualizations
16. determine most appropriate visualizations and analyses for specific research questions and data

### Unassessed objectives evaluation

If you believe you have demonstrated any of the above skills sufficiently to count toward the 20 additional objectives-based points, please indicate which objective(s) you believe you have met and provide a brief explanation of how you have met each objective.

<!-- Explanation of demonstrated unassessed objectives below this line -->


<!-- Explanation of demonstrated unassessed objectives above this line -->

### Off-the-syllabus skills evaluation

If you have demonstrated any off-the-syllabus skills related to the course but not directly covered in class, please describe the skill(s) and how you have demonstrated them in your project. These may include things like building Quarto websites, working with non-tabular data, creating Shiny or other interactive applications, etc. Menu items marked "OtS" should demonstrate these skills, but you may demonstrate them in any other menu item or off-the-menu project.

## Reflection

Optionally, you may provide a brief reflection on your experience with this project. What did you learn? What would you do differently next time? What was the most challenging part of the project? What was the most rewarding? You do not have to answer these questions directly; they are just meant to help you think about your experience.

Thoughtful reflections may earn engagement points.

## Grader feedback

-   Grader:
-   Date:
-   Points toward unique objectives (up to 20):
-   Additional points (up to 20):
-   TA provisional engagement points (up to 10):
-   Final approved engagement points (up to 10):
-   Total points (up to 50):

Engagement points are awarded for going above and beyond the expectations of the project and are not guaranteed on any given submission. Demonstrating the assessed learning objectives earns you points in those categories, but engagement points are awarded for exceptional effort, creativity, or skill.

TAs may recommend engagement points provisionally, but the instructor will make the final decision on engagement points.
